        <h2>A Weekend on the Seine</h2>
        <p>I was lucky enough to spend three days visiting Paris this month! I went with a friend and we were able to see many things while we were there!</p>

    <!-- Day 1 -->
      <h4 id="day1">Day 1</h4>
      <p>On our first day, we started by visiting <em>Montmartre</em> right away. Our second stop was the Eiffel Tower (check out that beautiful picture!) We ate dinner at a cute little bistro overlooking la Seine.</p>

    <!-- Day 2 -->

      <h4>Day 2</h4>
      <p>On our second day, we went shopping on Avenue des Champs Elysees. Every single person we saw was dressed in the height of fashion. </p>
      <p>After we finished shopping, we visited some really beautiful places! We went to Notre Dame. We went on a macaron tour of Paris and ate all of the best macarons the city had to offer. After we finished shopping, we visited le Louvre.</p>

    <!-- Day 3 -->
